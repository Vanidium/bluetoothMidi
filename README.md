# BluetoothMidi
This open source app is made for use with do-it-yourself Bluetooth Midi devices based on HM10 BLE UART modules. 
When one or more modules are connected, the Midi commands this app receives will be sent to the selected destination, which can for example be a piano app.

A Midi Bluetooth module can easily and cheaply be made for standalone use or to be incorporated in your DIY midi controller project.
